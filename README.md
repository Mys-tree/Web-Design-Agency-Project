# Web-Design-Agency-project
This is a project I just completed for my course work. The main body of the html was written by Angela Lu, I have added some extra HTML to credit this
The CSS is written by me - I did need a bit of help initially however I have added a background color to the images and text as I wanted to experiment 
with responsiveness for the background and contents to change size with more flow. I worked out how to do this all on my own.
